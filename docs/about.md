# About the author

Hi I'm Willem, a technology advocate for Info Support. I spend a lot of my time working on AI
solutions for customers or for fun. Because of my work in AI I spend a lot of time working with TensorFlow.

## Why this guide?

While the documentation on the TensorFlow website is really awesome, it's a bit all over the place
and there's no clear road taking you from start to finish. 

This guide aims to solve that problem. I want to tell you the story from start to finish.
Beginning with: What is a neural network and why would you need something like TensorFlow.
And ending with: How do I bring my models to production and keep things safe for my customers.
