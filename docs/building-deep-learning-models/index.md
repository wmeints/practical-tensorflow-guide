# Building deep learning models

In the previous section of the guide we've learned how to install TensorFlow and
build a basic neural network. In this section we're going to look at building
neural networks in greater depth.

We'll cover the following topics in this section:

- [Building a feed-forward network](./building-a-feed-forward-network.md)
- [Validating model performance](./validating-model-performance.md)
- [Working with images](./working-with-images.md)
- [Working with sequences](./working-with-sequences.md)
- [Using model explainers](./using-model-explainers.md)
