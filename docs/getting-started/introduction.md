# Introduction

In this section of the guide, we're going to take a look at the basic concepts
behind deep learning with TensorFlow. We'll cover the following topics:

- [What is deep learning?](#what-is-deep-learning)
- [The relationship between AI, machine learning, and deep learning](#the-relationship-between-ai-machine-learning-and-deep-learning)
- [How does machine learning work?](#how-does-machine-learning-work)
- [What are neural networks?](#what-are-neural-networks)
- [What is TensorFlow?](#what-is-tensorflow)
- [Summary](#summary)

Let's first discuss what deep learning is and how it relates to other AI
techniques that you may have heard about before.

## What is deep learning?

To understand what deep learning is, we need to first zoom out a bit towards the
field of AI. It's quite a big area within computer science. 

## The relationship between AI, machine learning, and deep learning

AI or Artificial Intelligence is an area that works on systems that show apparent intelligent behavior.
The systems that apply AI techniques don't have to be very smart at all. As soon as they show types of
behavior that we expect from intelligent beings, you can classify the system as being artificially intelligent.

As such there are quite a few different techniques that can be used to produce AI systems:

* [Symbolic AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence)
* [Reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)
* [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)
* [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)

If we were to visualize the relationship between AI, machine learning, and deep learning
it would look like the image below:

Deep learning in this map is part of a larger group of algorithms classified as machine learning.
Which again is part of the group of AI algorithms.

Machine learning, and deep learning are based on statistical learning methods. 
We're using statistical properties of data to recognize patterns and make 
predictions based on those patterns.

Where machine learning is good at recognizing basic patterns, deep learning
is good at recognizing complex patterns. As such deep learning is well suited for complicated
problems like recognizing medical conditions in images or translating sounds. You can use deep
learning for solving simple machine learning problems, but we don't recommend it as you're wasting
valuable resources on your computer. Also, you'll find that deep learning is easily beaten by
a linear machine learning model when solving basic AI problems.

Before diving into deep learning and TensorFlow it's good to take a deeper look at how a computer
learns to recognize patterns from data using machine learning. This introduction will provide you
a solid understanding of the basics before looking at the more complicated topic of deep learning.
